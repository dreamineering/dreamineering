Protocols vs best tech and impact?

## Engineering

[Protocols](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/process-engineering/) run the world. Evolve a [decision checklist](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software-engineering/tech-stack/tech-stack-decisions/) to evaluation best fit option to create tech stacks the meet demands of various industries and business models.

- [Business Software](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/business/business-functions/revenue/product-mgt/)
- [Solution Stack](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software-engineering/tech-stack/)
- [Blockchains](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/blockchain-architecture/blockchain-stack-decisions/)
- [AI LLMs](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/ai-data-engineering/ai-engineering/ai-llms/)

Conviction: All software is converging on games. It is easier to edit or delete than to conceive and create when getting started. Mastery is being able to delete as much as possible to achieve desired results.
