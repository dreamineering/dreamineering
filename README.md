# Dreamineering

Dreams are born twice: first in the mind and then reality. 

## Belief

Crypto is a [cultural movement](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/culture/). 

The games we choose to invest our attention in form our strongest cultural bonds.

## Purpose

Engineer systems that provide meaning to being human in the feedback loop.

## Core Principles

All code can be copied or forked, but you cannot fork culture nor the land and buildings that form a culture's roots. 

1. **Engineer-to-Entrepreneur**: Bridging the gap between technical expertise and business acumen.
2. **AI-Driven Marketing**: Leveraging AI for targeted, customized marketing campaigns.
3. **Crypto-Powered Incentives**: Using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to align stakeholder interests.
4. **Community-Centric Approach**: Building loyal customer bases that evolve into active salesforces.
