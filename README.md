# Dreamineering

How do you [maximize leverage](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/business/business-principles/business-principles-leverage/) to optimise the [transformation and distribution](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software-engineering/algorithms/routing-algorithm) of value?

- [A](https://github.com/dreamineering/dreamineering/tree/main/ai): Artificial Intelligence
- [B](https://github.com/dreamineering/dreamineering/tree/main/bc) : Blockchain Strategy

## Growth

[Play](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow) to learn, [experiment](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments) to grow.

- [Dreamineering](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/): Sell ideas that generate growth
- [Better Practice](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/): Better practice, better decisions, better lives
- [Stackmates](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/): Tokenised Real Estate Development
- [Prettymint](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/): AI & BC powered marketing Agency
- [Howzus](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/): Social app celebrating achievement through teamwork
- [Crypto Golf](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/): Learn together by sharing risk to play with crypto capital

Capturing the [imagination](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/process-flow/flow-dream/) and aligning intentions of [key stakeholders](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/people/human-nature/archetypes/) is the biggest challenge to [sparking growth](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/growth-experiments/).

## Business

It takes a village to raise a child, it takes an ecosystem to raise a business. [Communities](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/people/networks/culture/) are the future of [business](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/business) via incorruptible systems of governance.

Any community is only as strong as it's [culture for onboarding](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/people/networks/culture/onboarding) newcomers.

Any piece of software reflects the organisational communication structure that produced it - [Conway's Law](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/decision-process/engineering-laws/#conways-law)

## Engineering

Engineering solutions is not hard once the true problem is identfied.

It is easier to edit or delete than to conceive and create when getting started. Mastery is deleting as much as possible to deliver more with less.

- [Protocols](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/process-engineering/) run the world.

### Decisions

Evolve a [decision checklist](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software-engineering/tech-stack/tech-stack-decisions/) to evaluation best fit option to create tech stacks the meet demands of various industries and business models.

- [Solution Stack](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software-engineering/tech-stack/)
- [Blockchains](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/blockchain-architecture/blockchain-stack-decisions/)
- [AI LLMs](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/ai-data-engineering/ai-engineering/ai-llms/)
- [Business Tools](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/business/business-functions/revenue/product-mgt/)

[Convictions](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/grow/decision-process/decision-perspective/big-picture-convictions)

- Games push tech to creative limits. Playing games builds trust and loyalty. All software is converging on becoming a game.
- Collecting and processing trusted proprietary data is where the value lies.
- For a piece of information to be valuable it needs to be actionable.
- Any protocol is only going to be valuable as it's [proprietary data](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software-engineering/algorithms/routing-algorithm).

### Blockchains

Which blockchains support your **crypto enabled** ecosystem best?

#### EVM

How do you [differentiate value proposition](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/business/business-functions/revenue/sales/sales-pitch) of Etheruem L2s?

- [ ] Ethereum
  - [ ] Arbitrum
  - [ ] Optimism
  - [ ] zkSync
- [ ] Polygon
- [ ] Avalanche

#### SVM / Other

Best suited to DePIN? Why?

- [ ] Solana
- [ ] IoTex

### Languages

Power vs utility?

1. Rust
2. Typescript
3. Python
4. Solidity

Rust goes deep and is difficult for the masses to grok.

### Smart Contracts

Standard and best practice patterns.

What is the value of writing an open source smart contract anyone else can should copy as basis for their own protocol?
